## 1. Probability Practice
### **Part A** 
> Q: Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey question before they get access to the content on the page. Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3. After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65% said Yes and 35% said No. What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes? Hint: use the rule of total probability.

### **Part B**
> Imagine a medical test for a disease with the following two attributes:
> 
> - The sensitivity is about 0.993. That is, if someone has the disease, there is a probability of 0.993 that they will test positive.
> - The specificity is about 0.9999. This means that if someone doesn't have the disease, there is probability of 0.9999 that they will test negative.
> - In the general population, incidence of the disease is reasonably rare: about 0.0025% of all people have it (or 0.000025 as a decimal probability).
>
> Suppose someone tests positive. What is the probability that they have the disease?

## 2. Wrangling the Billboard Top 100
**Part A**
> Make a table of the top 10 most popular songs since 1958, as measured by the total number of weeks that a song spent on the Billboard Top 100. Note that these data end in week 22 of 2021, so the most popular songs of 2021 will not have up-to-the-minute data; please send our apologies to The Weeknd.

**Part B**
> Is the "musical diversity" of the Billboard Top 100 changing over time? Let's find out. We'll measure the musical diversity of given year as the number of unique songs that appeared in the Billboard Top 100 that year. Make a line graph that plots this measure of musical diversity over the years. The x axis should show the year, while the y axis should show the number of unique songs appearing at any position on the Billboard Top 100 chart in any week that year. For this part, please filter the data set so that it excludes the years 1958 and 2021, since we do not have complete data on either of those years. Give the figure an informative caption in which you explain what is shown in the figure and comment on any interesting trends you see.

**Part C**
> Let's define a "ten-week hit" as a single song that appeared on the Billboard Top 100 for at least ten weeks. There are 19 artists in U.S. musical history since 1958 who have had at least 30 songs that were "ten-week hits." Make a bar plot for these 19 artists, showing how many ten-week hits each one had in their musical career. Give the plot an informative caption in which you explain what is shown.

## 3. Visual story telling part 1: green buildings


## 4. Visual story telling part 2: Capital Metro data
> Your task is to create a figure, or set of related figures, that tell an interesting story about Capital Metro ridership patterns around the UT-Austin campus during the semester in question. Provide a clear annotation/caption for each figure, but the figure(s) should be more or less stand-alone, in that you shouldn't need many, many paragraphs to convey its meaning. Rather, the figure together with a concise caption should speak for itself as far as possible.
