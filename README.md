## 1. Probability Practice
### **Part A** 
> Q: Visitors to your website are asked to answer a single survey question before they get access to the content on the page. Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3. After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65% said Yes and 35% said No. What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes? Hint: use the rule of total probability.

### **Part B**
> Imagine a medical test for a disease with the following two attributes:
> 
> - The sensitivity is about 0.993. That is, if someone has the disease, there is a probability of 0.993 that they will test positive.
> - The specificity is about 0.9999. This means that if someone doesn't have the disease, there is probability of 0.9999 that they will test negative.
> - In the general population, incidence of the disease is reasonably rare: about 0.0025% of all people have it (or 0.000025 as a decimal probability).
>
> Suppose someone tests positive. What is the probability that they have the disease?

## 2. Wrangling the Billboard Top 100
**Part A**
> Make a table of the top 10 most popular songs since 1958, as measured by the total number of weeks that a song spent on the Billboard Top 100. Note that these data end in week 22 of 2021, so the most popular songs of 2021 will not have up-to-the-minute data; please send our apologies to The Weeknd.

**Part B**
> Is the "musical diversity" of the Billboard Top 100 changing over time? Let's find out. We'll measure the musical diversity of given year as the number of unique songs that appeared in the Billboard Top 100 that year. Make a line graph that plots this measure of musical diversity over the years. The x axis should show the year, while the y axis should show the number of unique songs appearing at any position on the Billboard Top 100 chart in any week that year. For this part, please filter the data set so that it excludes the years 1958 and 2021, since we do not have complete data on either of those years. Give the figure an informative caption in which you explain what is shown in the figure and comment on any interesting trends you see.

**Part C**
> Let's define a "ten-week hit" as a single song that appeared on the Billboard Top 100 for at least ten weeks. There are 19 artists in U.S. musical history since 1958 who have had at least 30 songs that were "ten-week hits." Make a bar plot for these 19 artists, showing how many ten-week hits each one had in their musical career. Give the plot an informative caption in which you explain what is shown.

## 3. Visual story telling part 1: green buildings
> An Austin real-estate developer is interested in the possible economic impact of "going green" in her latest project: a new 15-story mixed-use building on East Cesar Chavez, just across I-35 from downtown. Will investing in a green building be worth it, from an economic perspective? The baseline construction costs are $100 million, with a 5% expected premium for green certification.
> 
> Do you agree with the conclusions of her on-staff stats guru? If so, point to evidence supporting his case. If not, explain specifically where and why the analysis goes wrong, and how it can be improved. Do you see the possibility of confounding variables for the relationship between rent and green status? If so, provide evidence for confounding, and see if you can also make a picture that visually shows how we might "adjust" for such a confounder. Tell your story in pictures, with appropriate introductory and supporting text.

The analysis conducted by the stats guru appears to be solid, but it relies on several key assumptions:

1. The square footage of a green building is approximately the same as that of a non-green building, implying that the green building would achieve similar profit margins for homes of the same size.
2. Green buildings are expected to quickly reach full occupancy and maximize their profit potential each year.
3. The median market rent for green buildings is actually $2.60 more per square feet than non-green buildings.

My goal is to investigate whether these assumptions hold true and to assess how they may affect rental income. Additionally, I want to create clusters that are based on shared traits rather than geographically locations to provide a better prediction of rent prices of green and non-green buildings that are similar to one that the developer wants to construct. The purpose being to compare the profits of going green vs building a regular building. 

See [here](Q3/Visual-Storytelling-Pt1.md) for my code and a walkthrough of my process and conclusion. 

In summary, clustering revealed that a green building yields slightly higher rental income compared to a non-green building, meaning it would take approximately 2.44 years to recoup the additional 5% premium for constructing a green buildingâ€”less than the stat guru predicted. This strongly supports his conclusion to proceed with the construction of the green building.


## 4. Visual story telling part 2: Capital Metro data
> Your task is to create a figure, or set of related figures, that tell an interesting story about Capital Metro ridership patterns around the UT-Austin campus during the semester in question. Provide a clear annotation/caption for each figure, but the figure(s) should be more or less stand-alone, in that you shouldn't need many, many paragraphs to convey its meaning. Rather, the figure together with a concise caption should speak for itself as far as possible.

Response [here](Q4/Visual-Story-Telling-Pt2-CapMetro.md).

## 5. Clustering and dimensionality reduction
> Run PCA, tSNE, and any clustering algorithm of your choice on the 11 chemical properties (or suitable transformations thereof) and summarize your results. Which dimensionality reduction technique makes the most sense to you for this data? Convince yourself (and me) that your chosen approach is easily capable of distinguishing the reds from the whites, using only the "unsupervised" information contained in the data on chemical properties. Does your unsupervised technique also seem capable of distinguishing the higher from the lower quality wines? Present appropriate numerical and/or visual evidence to support your conclusions.

Using PCA for clustering wine colors and t-SNE for clustering quality makes sense due to the differing complexity of each. The relationship between features and wine color is mostly linear, making PCA suitable. Conversely, the factors influencing wine quality are more complex and may require non-linear considerations, which is why t-SNE or a combination of PCA and t-SNE might be more effective. The results support this approach.

The best model for predicting wine color was K-Means clustering after PCA, which accurately clustered about 98.5% of the wines into the correct color category. However, this method performed poorly for clustering wine quality, correctly labeling only about 12.4% of the data. Incorporating t-SNE improved the accuracy by about 6%, but 16% accuracy is still quite low. This suggests that the current unsupervised technique is not very effective at distinguishing wine quality. Feature engineering and/or binning of the quality scores may enhance the accuracy.

## 6. Market segmentation
> Your task to is analyze this data as you see fit, and to prepare a concise report for NutrientH20 that identifies any interesting market segments that appear to stand out in their social-media audience. You have complete freedom in deciding how to pre-process the data and how to define "market segment." (Is it a group of correlated interests? A cluster? A latent factor? Etc.) Just use the data to come up with some interesting, well-supported insights about the audience, and be clear about what you did.

Code [here](Q6/Market-Segmentation.md).

After conducting some EDA, I observed that the followers of NutritionH20 primarily seem to be interested in the personal health field (see *Distribution of Followers by Category* boxplot). Given that the company alias is NutritionH20, which suggests a focus on wellness, this observation aligns with expectations. My focus then shifted to exploring other interests of the followers. To achieve this, I performed both K-Means and hierarchical clustering using all predictors except for *personal_health* (an aggregation of the original variables *personal_fitness* and *health_nutrition*).

By employing an elbow curve and experimenting with different numbers of clusters, I decided to segment the market into 4 categories. Hierarchical clustering did not yield meaningful results; it clustered the majority into one category and distributed the outliers into three other categories, regardless of the linkage function used. Therefore, I opted for K-Means clustering.

The primary topics tweeted about by each of the 4 clusters are summarized as follows:

**Cluster 1** (10% of data)
- food
- religion
- family and parenting

This cluster is most likely composed of Millennials and Gen Xers who have children and are exploring their spirituality.

**Cluster 2** (8% of data)
- sharing photos
- cooking
- beauty
- fashion

This cluster likely comprises women, given their interest in topics associated with femininity.

**Cluster 3** (61% of data)
- not very interested in anything

Most of the dataset falls into this cluster. Followers in this cluster do not tend to tweet about any one subject more than others.

**Cluster 4** (22% of data)
- travel
- tv/film
- online gaming
- shopping
- computers
- business
- cars
- dating
- small businesses
- news and politics
- arts and crafts
- school

This cluster most likely groups Gen Z individuals. They frequently discuss topics related to school, leisure activities, and political/socio-economic issues.

Although the majority of followers are in cluster 3, there are no clear topics that *NutritionH20* can use in their ads to engage this group effectively. This might indicate that a targeted approach towards a single category could be counterproductive. For instance, maintaining a politically neutral stance might be the best strategy for retaining this particular market segment. 

The next largest cluster consists of Gen Z individuals. As this group is expected to become the predominant consumer base, it would be advantageous to start building brand loyalty with them now. To avoid alienating cluster 3, the company should focus on less controversial interests. Given the company's health-oriented focus, marketing to young people engaged in indoor activities (such as gaming, tech, TV, and arts and crafts) might be effective. Offering products that address the negative health effects associated with these activities could be a promising approach.


## 7. The Reuters corpus
> Your task is simple: tell an interesting story, anchored in some analytical tools we have learned in this class, using this data. Describe clearly what question you are trying to answer, what models you are using, how you pre-processed the data, and so forth. Make sure you include at least one really interesting plot (although more than one might be necessary, depending on your question and approach.)
>
> Format your write-up in the following sections, some of which might be quite short:
>
> - Question: What question(s) are you trying to answer?
> - Approach: What approach/statistical tool did you use to answer the questions?
> - Results: What evidence/results did your approach provide to answer the questions? (E.g. any numbers, tables, figures as appropriate.)
> - Conclusion: What are your conclusions about your questions? Provide a written interpretation of your results, understandable to stakeholders who might plausibly take an interest in this data set.

**Question**

What main topics can we sort the documents in the Reuters corpus into?

**Approach**

I used K-Means to group the data into 7 clusters (based on the elbow curve) and then extracted the 15 most common non-stop words from each cluster.

**Results**

See [here](Q7/Reuters-Corpus.ipynb) for code and figures.

The main topic of each cluster, which I identified by analyzing the common words, was:

- Cluster 0: Oil Stocks & Trade
    - Common words: dlrs, lt, pct, shares, oil, stock, share, trade, new, offer, first, dividend, price, last, also
- Cluster 1: Shares & Sales Revenue
    - Common words: shr, revs, qtr, dlrs, shrs, lt, mths, oper, st, sales, rd, th, share, jan, includes
- Cluster 2: Food Export and Productions
    - Common words: tonnes, wheat, sugar, corn, export, grain, ec, tender, exports, traders, usda, maize, tonne, production, department
- Cluster 3: US Dollar and Japanese Yen Exchange
    - Common words: pct, bank, rate, stg, money, market, dollar, rates, yen, rise, billion, rose, fed, japan, dealers
- Cluster 4: Divident Payouts
    - Common words: div, qtly, record, pay, prior, sets, dividend, payout, lt, quarterly, regular, payable, qtrly, raises, franklin
- Cluster 5: Swiss Federal Reserves
    - Common words: billion, dlrs, surplus, deficit, shr, francs, rose, loans, reserves, marks, trade, fed, fell, deposits, assets
- Cluster 6: Financial Statements
    - Common words: loss, profit, shr, revs, dlrs, qtr, oper, th, lt, shrs, includes, mths, sales, gain, st

Looking at the cluster plots using both PCA and t-SNE, we can see that the clusters are not entirely distinctâ€”there's some overlap between them. In the PCA cluster plot, clusters 0-5 show some overlap, with the most significant overlap occurring between clusters 3 and 4, which are almost indistinguishable. In the t-SNE plot, the clusters are somewhat more spread out, except for cluster 0, which overlaps with all the others. The only cluster that clearly stands out is cluster 6, which is interesting considering that many of its most important words have meanings that overlap with those in other clusters.

**Conclusion** 

All of the documents in the Reuters corpus seem to discuss various aspects of the financial sector. Some focus on company shares and sales, others address specific industries like food and oil, while some explore interactions between international markets. The accumulation of such information can grow exponentially, so having a sorting method like clustering can help stakeholders better organize their information before making important financial decisions. The clustering method I chose is not entirely accurate, as there is significant overlap between topics in different clusters. This is partly because I did not use a token that accounts for all variations of the same financial terms. For example, the word "shares" can appear in these documents as "share," "shr," and "shrs," which are treated as separate words by the token I am using. By using a better token or consulting a financial expert to combine related tokens into single types, the filtering of words can be cleaner, leading to more accurate clusters. Once organized properly, stakeholders can more easily access the information they need without having to sift through the plethora of documents.


## 8. Association rule mining
> Find some interesting association rules for these shopping baskets. The data file is a list of shopping baskets: one person's basket for each row, with multiple items per row separated by commas. Pick your own thresholds for lift and confidence; just be clear what these thresholds are and say why you picked them. Do your discovered item sets make sense? Present your discoveries in an interesting and visually appealing way.

Response [here](Q8/Assoc-Rule-Mining.md).

## 9. Image classification with neural networks
> Your job is to set up a neural network that can classify the images as accurately as possible. Use an 80/20 train test split. Summarize your model and its accuracy in any way you see fit, but make you include at a minimum the following elements:
> - overall test-set accuracy, measured however you think is appropriate
> - show some of the example images from the test set, together with your model's predicted classes.
> - a confusion matrix showing the performance of the model on the set test, i.e. a table that cross-tabulates each test set example by (actual class, predicted class).

See code and accuracy [here](Q9/Image-Classification.ipynb).

This neural network is designed to classify satellite images into one of 11 land use categories. The network has three main layers: convolutional layers that detect patterns and features in the images, a pooling layer that reduces the size of the data while keeping important information, and fully connected layers that make the final predictions based on the features. The hyperparameters include the number of filters in the convolutional layers (32, 64, and 128), the size of the filters (3x3), and the learning rate (0.001) that controls how quickly the model learns. These settings help the network learn and make accurate predictions from the images.
